## What is Parcel?
Parcel is a custom package manager written to work with luau modules, source code and dependencies.

## How do I use Parcel?
To be able to use parcel, please make sure you have a valid instalation of <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/luau/releases">Luau</a>

## How will Parcel packages be handled?
Upon uploading a package, the package will be saved as a <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/362203/what-is-a-tar.gz-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/">tar.gz</a> and saved to the package registry under the selected version. Once a package is being installed it will be extracted into the parcel-packages folder.

## Please note the following:
Parcel is currently under heavy development and will most likely not be finished in the near future. But you are free to follow it's development.
